# EBB42V1.2CANBOOT
How to set up Klipper and CanBoot on a BTT EBB42 v1.2 toolhead and CanBus on RPi using CANHAT.  Ported from https://maz0r.github.io/klipper_canbus/toolhead/ebb36-42_v1.1.html

I had a heck of a time getting this set up.  
BTT's instructions are...not great.  
I was pointed to Maz0r's instructions from the VORON Discord and will mirror them here at some point.  

Links to Maz0r's awesome instructions:

https://maz0r.github.io/klipper_canbus/controller/rs485.html - Raspberry Pi CANHAT instructions


I may also work on an ESP32-based CANBus controller to remove the need to run Klipper on an RPi with a CANHat.

Will update this to cover the EBB36v1.2 as soon as that is delivered.
